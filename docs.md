Description
========================================================
The UK government have made available a set of monthly weather measurements for a number of weather stations. The data in some cases goes back to the 1800s and covers the whole country.

The measurements are:
* Minimum temperature
* Maximum temperature
* Days of sun
* Days of rain
* Days with air frost

This project is an explorer application that lets you see the stations on a map and view the data series for each one.
